</p>

## Project Overview 

**Catculation Countdown**  is a website developed from the idea from the Love Maths project. The inspiration came from my daughter's love of learning maths and cats, especially addition and subtraction sums in school and at home.

I have designed the website to look child friendly as its main focus. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for children and parents. 

The goal of the website is a simple addition and subtraction game, where the user is played against a timer with a multiple choice answers.

#### Website is fully responsive, with use of 4 breakpoints:

- 375px - mobile size,
- 768px - tablet size,

- 1950px - desktop large size.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

<p align="center">
<img src="README.docs/colour.png" width="60%" height="60%">
</p>

The website uses a mixture of colours thats bright and attractive, I wanted to choose colours to reflect the creative personality of the cat character and my daughter favourite colours. 

### Typography

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

  - Used 'Roboto': "light 300", sans-serif and  font for the website as it great for accessibility.
  

### Imagery

Images were used from Freepik.com 

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Features

The maths game is composed of one webpage. The page on the website will have:

- An simple and colourful page structure so that the user can easily start the game.
- "Start" button - starts the game for the user.
- Instructions of how to play.
- "Reset" button - user can reset the game and play again.
- "Game Over Feature" - after the timer reaches to 0 sec, a game over window appears showing the score the user has achieved. 
- Contact form - user can contact the game provider if they has questions or suggestions for the game.
- Footer - contains social media links. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. 

**Title**
- Located at top of the page.  
  
**Score Area**
- Area where the user can visually see their score each time they choose correct answer from multiply choice.   

**Game Area**
- This section gives instructions of how to play the game. Also where the question will appear when the game is started. 

**Multiple answer choices**
- This section shows four answers to the question at hand. Only one is correct, once the correct answer is clicked on a new question appears. A different cat noise sounds for incorrect or correct answer choosen. 

**Start Game section**
- When the user clicks on this, the game starts by a question appearing and the timer counts down from 60 seconds.
- After the game has started, this button changes to RESET GAME. 
- If user clicks on the RESET GAME button, a window message appears to let user know if they want to confirm to rest game or cancel. 

**Contact Form**
- Allows the user to contact the game provider if they has questions or suggestions for the game.

**Footer**
- Contains social media links. 

### Future Implementations.

  * Add more levels to increase difficulty. For example, larger sums or division and multiplication levels. 
  * Send email notification to user once form has been submitted. 
  * Background soundtrack for the game, to engage the user more. 

### Accessibility 

I have been mindful during coding to ensure the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring there are sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Using font style with good accessibility.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Google Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.
Each device has been inspected using Google Chrome developer to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I have also physically tested the responsiveness of the site on a number of different devices and tested the game on my daughter. 

### Manual Testing 

#### Ensure that all user stories are achieved

For parents:

* When entering the webpage, the parent can easily see the bright,. attractive colours, images and content of the page.

* [Webpage HTML](README.docs/w3c.png)
* [Webpage CSS](README.docs/w3c_css.png)

### Lighthouse

I used lighthouse to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - how the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - how accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best practices - how does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - search engine optimization. Is the site optimized for search engine result rankings.

### Bugs and issues

1. The timer was decreasing too quickly and not at the correct interval. 

<p align="center">
<img src="README.docs/timer.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

- Fixed this issue by implenting the startCountdown near the beginning of the code and changing the code so it calculates the remaining time based on the elapsed time since the start of the countdown. This approach should provide a more accurate timer. 

2. Timer keeps stopping at 1sec not 0sec. 

<p align="center">
<img src="README.docs/timerbug.png" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

- Bug seen due to the interval timing. To ensure the timer displays 0 seconds when the game is over a small adjustment was made to the code. Bug fixed by clearing the interval when the timer reaches 0 seconds, by clearing the timerInterval when the game is reset.
