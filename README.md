## Project Overview 

**Catculation Countdown**  is a website developed from the idea from the Love Maths project. The inspiration came from my daughter's love of learning maths and cats, especially addition and subtraction sums in school and at home.

I have designed the website to look child friendly as its main focus. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for children and parents. 

The goal of the website is a simple addition and subtraction game, where the user is played against a timer with a multiple choice answers.

### Features

The website is composed of one page. The page on the website will have:

-An simple and colorful page structure so that the user can easily start the game.
-"Start" button - starts the game for the user.
-Instructions of how to play.
-"Reset" button - user can reset the game and play again.
-"Game Over Feature" - after the timer reaches to 0 sec, a game over window appears showing the score the user has achieved. 
-Contact form - user can contact the game provider if they has questions or suggestions for the game.
-Footer - contains social media links. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. 

  * Title. 
  Located at top of the page.  
  * Score Area.
  Area where the user can visually see their score each time they choose correct answer from multiply choice.   
  * Game Area
  This section gives instructions of how to play the game. Also where the question will appear whem the game is started. 
  * Multiple answer choices.
  This section shows four answers to the question at hand. Only one is correct, once the correct answer is clicked on a new question appears. 
  * Start Game section.
  When the user clicks on this, the game starts by a question appearing and the timer countsdown.
  *Contact Form. 
  Allows the user to contact the game provider if they has questions or suggestions for the game.
  * Footer. 
  Contains social media links. 

### Future Implementations.

  * Add more levels to increase difficulty, for example larger sums or division and multiplication levels. 
  * Send email notification to user once form has been submitted. 
  * Add sound when user clicks on correct answer. 

### Accessibility 

I have been mindful during coding to ensure the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring there are sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Using font style with good accessibility.
